# OpenStack API runnings under WSGI have a common function to calculate the number of workers:
# The value for os_workers is max between '(<# processors> / 2)' and '2' with
# a cap of 12.

# On vexxhost machines, we have 96 cores, so each API can create up to 12 workers.
# This has been problematic for us when deploying OpenShift with Kuryr which
# consumes a lot of load balancers and Octavia is using more than half of the RAM available on the host
# so we decided to reduce the number of workers to reduce the amount of RAM that will be consumed.
